# CPE333 PS02 – Build and run guide

Problem Session 2 covers process creation, process lifetime, `fork()`, `wait()`, and pipes.

- `problem-session.md` – assignment requirements.
- `src/` – starter C programs.
- `Makefile` – portable build commands.
- `notes/` – experiment observations and report material.

## Platform support

The programs require a C17 compiler and POSIX process APIs.

Works on:

- Linux – Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and others.
- WSL2 Linux distributions.
- macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools.
- BSD systems with a C compiler and POSIX shell.

Native Windows is not supported because it has no compatible `fork()` API. Use WSL2 or a Linux VM.

Building and running does not require `sudo`. Use administrator privileges only to install packages.

## Install prerequisites

Install the core tools for the platform. Debugging and tracing tools are optional.

### Debian, Ubuntu, and WSL2 Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git
sudo apt install -y gdb man-db manpages-dev procps psmisc strace
```

### Fedora, Rocky, Alma, and RHEL-like systems

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc make git
sudo dnf install -y gdb man-db man-pages procps-ng psmisc strace
```

If `sudo dnf` reports a package unavailable, install the first command and continue without that optional package.

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
sudo pacman -S --needed gdb man-db man-pages procps-ng psmisc strace
```

### macOS

Install Apple command-line tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

This provides `clang`, `make`, `git`, `ps`, `sleep`, and manual pages. Homebrew is optional:

```bash
brew install git
```

`strace` is Linux-only. Skip it on macOS.

### FreeBSD and other BSD systems

Use the system C compiler and `make`, or install GNU Make if required:

```bash
sudo pkg install gmake git gdb psmisc
```

Use `gmake` if the system `make` rejects the Makefile.

## Clone

Standalone clone – recommended:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beambeambeam/CPE333.git
cd CPE333/ps02
```

Already cloned:

```bash
cd ~/CPE333
git pull --ff-only origin main
cd ps02
```

Parent-repository clone:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/beambeambeam/my-cpe-lab.git
cd my-cpe-lab/Y3/CPE333/ps02
```

If the parent repository was cloned without submodules:

```bash
cd ~/my-cpe-lab
git pull --ff-only origin main
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd Y3/CPE333/ps02
```

## Build

```bash
make
```

The Makefile uses the platform C compiler by default through `cc`. Override it when needed:

```bash
make CC=gcc
make CC=clang
```

Compiler flags enable C17, warnings, and debugging symbols. Binaries are written to `bin/`, which is ignored by Git.

If `make` is unavailable, install it with the platform package manager. The programs can also be compiled directly:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
cc -std=c17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -O0 -g \
   src/01_hello.c -o bin/01_hello
```

Clean build output:

```bash
make clean
make
```

## Publish changes

CPE333 changes are committed and pushed from the standalone repository:

```bash
cd ~/CPE333
git add ps02
git commit -m "Update PS02 lab"
git push origin main
```

The parent repository stores a fixed CPE333 commit. Update its pointer only when needed:

```bash
cd ~/my-cpe-lab/Y3/CPE333
git pull --ff-only origin main
cd ../..
git add Y3/CPE333
git commit -m "Update CPE333 submodule"
git push origin main
```

## Build

```bash
make
```

Compiler flags enable C17, POSIX declarations, warnings, and debugging symbols. Binaries are written to `bin/`, which is ignored by Git.

Clean build output:

```bash
make clean
make
```

## Run starter programs

```bash
./bin/01_hello
./bin/02_hello_wait
./bin/03_lifetime child-first
./bin/03_lifetime parent-first
./bin/05_pipe
```

`03_lifetime child-first` keeps the parent alive while the child exits. Inspect the child during the parent sleep:

Portable process inspection for a known PID:

```bash
ps -p <pid> -o pid,ppid,stat,command
```

Linux-specific process tree commands:

```bash
ps -ef --forest
pstree -p "$$"
```

Some systems use different `ps` field names. If `command` is rejected, try `comm`.

The child can appear as `<defunct>` until the parent calls `waitpid()`.

`03_lifetime parent-first` exits the parent while the child continues. The child prints its parent PID before and after sleeping. The second PPID normally becomes PID 1 or another system subreaper.

## Fork-count safety

Take a VM snapshot before running this experiment. Run it as a normal user, never with `sudo`.

The program creates one child at a time and each parent waits, but it still must run under a process limit:

```bash
( ulimit -u 128; ./bin/04_fork_count )
```

The program reports successful `fork()` calls when `fork()` fails. Do not run an uncontrolled program where every process forks again.

To stop an experiment, inspect exact user process IDs first:

```bash
pgrep -a -u "$USER"
kill <pid>
```

## Manual pages

```bash
man 2 fork
man 2 wait
man 2 pipe
man 2 read
man 2 write
man 2 close
man 3 sleep
man 1 ps
```

Optional syscall trace:

```bash
strace -f ./bin/05_pipe
```

## Pipe observations to record

The base pipe program demonstrates child-to-parent communication. Create or modify variants for the required experiments:

1. A sender reading from the same pipe consumes bytes from the shared byte stream; it does not read a private copy.
2. A receiver reading before the sender writes blocks while a write end remains open.
3. Several writes can be returned by one read, or one message can be split across reads. A pipe has no message boundaries.
4. Closing every write end lets the reader receive EOF (`read()` returns `0`).

Save commands, output, PIDs, PPIDs, process states, and explanations in `notes/` for the PDF report.
